# Selenium Car Valuation Test Project

This project is a Test Automation suite for the car valuation website [WeBuyAnyCar](https://www.webuyanycar.com/), designed to validate car details and valuations based on vehicle registration, mileage, and user inputs. The tests are built using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, and managed with **Maven**.

## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK** 8 or later installed.
- **Maven** installed and configured in your system PATH.
- **ChromeDriver** for Selenium WebDriver (or an alternative WebDriver depending on your browser).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-car-valuation.git
    cd selenium-car-valuation
    ```

2. Install dependencies using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Ensure **ChromeDriver** is in the specified location or configured in your system PATH.

## Running the Tests

1. To run all tests, execute the following Maven command:
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

2. To run a specific test class, use:
    ```bash
    mvn -Dtest=ClassName test
    ```

3. To run a single test method, specify the class and method:
    ```bash
    mvn -Dtest=ClassName#methodName test
    ```

## Test Descriptions

- **Home Page Tests**: Validates the presence of registration and mileage input fields, and the 'Get Valuation' button.
- **Details Page Tests**: Verifies input fields for email, postcode, and telephone are present.
- **Car Detail Validation Tests**: Confirms that specific cars (based on registration) display correct model, year, and other details.
- **Price Range Validation Tests**: Ensures that valuations fall within expected price ranges based on predefined thresholds.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language for the test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Browser automation framework.
- **TestNG**: Testing framework for defining, organizing, and executing tests.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool, manages dependencies and simplifies test execution.

## Adding New Tests

1. **Add Page Objects**:
    - Navigate to `src/test/java/Pages`.
    - Add a new Java class to represent the new page.
    - Define web elements and interactions as methods.

2. **Add Tests**:
    - Navigate to `src/test/java/Tests`.
    - Create a new test method within an existing class or add a new test class.
    - Call Page Object methods to perform interactions and assertions.
  
3. **Add Utils**:
    - Navigate to `src/test/java/Utils`.
    - Create a new reusable method can be use to all test class.
    - Utility.

## Reporting

Test reports are generated by extentreports and saved in the `src/test/Report/report.html` directory after running the tests. You can view these reports for detailed test results.

## Troubleshooting

- **WebDriver Initialization**: If ChromeDriver isn't recognized ensure to download the correct OS and Chrome version.
- **Dependency Issues**: Run `mvn clean install` to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
